Feature: Wicked 4 combinations

  In order to be able to set up network interfaces
  As a network administrator doing weird combinations
  I should be able to use the new Wicked network interfaces broker

  Background:
    When the reference machine is set up correctly
    And the system under test is set up correctly
    And there is no core dump
    And the network services are started
    And the interfaces are in a basic state
    And the routing table is empty
    And there is no virtual interface left on any machine
